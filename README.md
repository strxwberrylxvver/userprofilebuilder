# SwingPorfolio Workshops - User Profile Builder App

In TB2 you will have 4 workshops (TB2 Exercises) that lead you through the development of a basic Swing App that can be the launch point of your own TB2 Coursework App (after reading week) as in the (CI5105 TB2 Week 2 - Reintroduction Lecture and Workshop)[https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/29973/pages/swing-portfolio-user-profile-builder-workshop-1]
 
The workshops will set you exercises that will use concepts introduced at the lectures and will allow you to develop a 'User Profile Builder' App that cn be the launch point for your Coursework App that will be introdcued after reading week. 
  
In the process you can get up to 5% per workshop. You will develop the code for all these workshops in this repository.  This will be fully assessed at the end of the workshops, however, there will be mark for your correct engagement in the process. Completing the Workshop Exercises on an incremental basis, correct use of KUGitlab and appropriate and frequent commits and commit messages as you progress.

# User Profile Builder App Start Code 

To use this code you should clone this project and run the sample code as covered in (Using KUGitlab - Introduction Gitlab Workflow)[https://canvas.kingston.ac.uk/courses/29973/pages/unit-1-week-12] 

To get this sample code onto your local machine you will need to:

- [ ]  [Create a project access token ](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#personal-access-tokens). This will be used to allow you to authenticate to GitLab.com/KUGitlab for the purposes of typical operations e.g. cloning and pushing to private repositories in your sub-group.  You will typically only need on e personal access token but you can create a new one whenever you require it and delete old ones. 
-[] Optionally Import the Project into your Portfolio Namespace - for 'Self-imported Repository' if it hasn't been 'Pre-imported'. Check if the Repository is already in your Namespace 
- [ ]  [Clone this new Repository using your Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html#clone-using-a-token). You can do this from an IDE (e.g. NetBeans) or from the command-line (e.g. Git Bash) 
- [ ] Use a Git development process (add, commit, push) to version manage your code.  This will be covered in the module but is [typically](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html). Currently your Portfolio Sub-Group has not been set-up and so you will not be able to push back your changes. You don't have the permission to do this to the origin repository - or else these changes would change the sample code for everyone else!
